TensorFlowCVN (NOvA deep learning workshop)

This release only works for MacOS. Instruction:
- Download and install Docker Desktop for MacOS: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop.
- Download and install XQuartz: https://www.xquartz.org or

```bash
brew cask install xquartz
```

- Check out this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dungducphan/tfcvn.git
cd tfcvn
mkdir workspace
source ./run.sh

- Make sure to make a folder named `workspace` and keep your code in it, otherwise it would not be persistent.
- Tools like `vim` or `kinit` are already available so you can connect to or send job to FermiGrid.
